# MS3-Coding-Challenge
Coding Challenge given to me by MS3

For this challenge I tried to create code that read a file into a table. This was difficult for me because I am not familiar with SQLite but I tried to look into it online as best as I could. I started by focusing on reading the elements of the file into a table. For this I first tried to create a class that had the 10 different coloumns that were in the table in the file. Once I did this, I then started to work on reading the file into a table. I drew from some of the experience I had reading files into tables as well as looking at examples I found online. I tried to keep track of the statistics that were asked for in part 4 of the prompt amd read them out.
I wrote most of this code using the NetBeans program under the package csvtosqlite. This was a very difficult challenge for me and I did my best trying meet the requirements, but I am aware that I have room to grow.
